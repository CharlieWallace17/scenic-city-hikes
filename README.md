# Scenic City Hikes

A website dedicated to showcasing the local Chattanooga hiking gems. Scenic City Hikes is a place where users can explore, connect, and support the natural beauty of Chattanooga, TN.

## Description

We set out to make Scenic City Hikes as interactive as possible for the user. The UI is sleek and simple, allowing the breathtaking images to take their rightful place as the site's focal point. We tried to make the UX as intuitive and responsive as possible, giving users incentive to explore and click around to see what they may find.

## Features

Application features include:
 * Simple and responsive navigation menu.
 * Gorgeous clickable images displayed in an array of polaroid pictures.
 * Footer with convenient links to various social media.
 * Elegant About Us page that provides a short and sweet mission statement.
 * Interactive custom Google map, providing locations to trails.
 * Donation page, in which users can donate via PayPal or Venmo.
 * Responsive contact form for user feedback.

## Technology

The following tech was used when building this application:

 * bootstrap--to implement professional, clean-looking styles and layouts.
 * formik--allow for generation of neat, responsive form with error feedback.
 * react--for development of fast, responsive UI.
 * react-google-maps-api--convenient wrapper for quick access to Google Maps API.
 * react-paypal-js--abstract away user payment complexities for best checkout experience.
 * react-spring--fluid animation sequences for polaroid flipping.
 * reactstrap--create seemless interaction between bootstrap and react.
 * sass--comes with bootstrap and increases ease of CSS manipulation.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `sass-dev`

Runs sass for development purposes. It has a source map and a watcher and is not compressed.

### `sass-prod`

Runs sass for production purposes. It does not have a source map, is compressed, and only runs once.

### `dev`

Runs "npm run start" and "npm run sass-dev" at the same time with concurrently for a quick shortcut into a full development environment.
